### Task
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order.Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
```
function descendingOrder(n) {
  let arr = Array.from(String(n), Number)
  let arr2 = arr.sort(function (a, b) {
    return b - a;
  })
  return Number(arr2.join(''));

}
